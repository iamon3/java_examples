 * 
 * Sometimes we need to execute a task periodically or after specific delay. 
 * Java provides Timer Class through which we can achieve this but sometimes we need to run similar tasks in parallel. 
 * So creating multiple Timer objects will be an overhead to the system and itâ€™s better to have a thread pool of scheduled tasks.
 * Java provides scheduled thread pool implementation through ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor class that implements ScheduledExecutorService interface. 
 * ScheduledExecutorService defines the contract methods to schedule a task with different options.
